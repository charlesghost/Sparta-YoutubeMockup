		<p>"California Love" is a hip hop song by 2Pac featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman. The song was released as 2Pac's comeback single after his release from prison in 1995 and was his first single as a Death Row Records artist. This is one of 2Pac's most widely known singles and his most successful, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks (as a double A-side single with "How Do U Want It") and 5 weeks at number one in New Zealand. The song was nominated for a posthumous Grammy Award as a Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman) in 1997.

		A popular remix version of the song appeared on his 1996 double album All Eyez on Me, the first double album in the history of hip-hop.</p>
